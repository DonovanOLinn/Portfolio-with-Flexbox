                    <p id="article2-description">I have a lot of hobbies, but my biggest one is probably to play videogames. I originally went to art school to learn to make videogames. It was there I fell in love with the programming 
                        side of games. Unfortunately, with my school being an art school, there weren't many programming classes around that focused on that side of things. So here I am now!
                        <br>
                        I also have a love of anime. I am currently watching Black Clover. It has been on my list for years and I ahve run out of other things to watch so I'm now finally catching up on it.
